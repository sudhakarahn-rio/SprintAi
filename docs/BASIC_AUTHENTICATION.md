# Basic Authentication

This document describes the first-version authentication model for QuizMaker: user accounts, sign-up and login, how sessions tie to server actions and API routes, and how authentication stays **basic but migration-friendly** toward a framework-based solution (e.g. NextAuth.js, Clerk, WorkOS) later.

## Goals

- Users can **sign up** and **log in** with credentials stored in **D1** (via the existing `quizmaker_app_database` binding and `lib/d1-client.ts` patterns).
- **Attempts** on MCQs are always associated with an authenticated **user ID** (see `MCQ_CRUD.md`).
- Passwords are **never stored in plain text**; only a strong one-way hash is persisted.
- Session handling is explicit enough to swap for JWT/OAuth/cookies managed by a dedicated library without rewriting the whole domain model.

## User Model

| Field | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **User ID** | Stable primary key (recommended: UUID/text id, or integer with `AUTOINCREMENT` in D1). Exposed in app code as `userId`. |
| **First name** | Required for display and future profile features. |
| **Last name** | Required for display and future profile features. |
| **Username** | Unique, human-readable identifier. |
| **Email** | Unique; may match username for users who prefer email-as-login. Validation: basic email format server-side. |
| **Password** | Stored only as a **password hash** (see below). |

### Uniqueness and login identifier

- Enforce **unique** constraints on `username` and `email` in the database.
- **Login** may accept **email or username** in a single field (recommended UX), resolved server-side to one user row.

## Password Storage

- On sign-up (and password change, when added later): hash with a modern, slow-by-design algorithm (**Argon2id** preferred if available in the Workers runtime; otherwise **bcrypt** with a sensible cost factor).
- Store only: `password_hash`, optional `password_hash_algorithm` / version column if you want safe future algorithm rotation.
- Never log passwords or hashes in application logs.

## Session Model (v1)

A minimal, swappable approach:

- After successful login, issue a **signed session token** (e.g. JWT or opaque id) stored in an **HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Lax** cookie.
- Session payload should include at least `userId` and an expiry; refresh or sliding expiry can be added later.
- **Sign-up** should log the user in the same way (same cookie shape) to reduce duplicate code paths.

### Migration path to a framework

- Keep **user table and password hashing** in dedicated modules (`lib/auth/password.ts`, `lib/auth/session.ts` or similar).
- Replace cookie issuance/verification with NextAuth/Clerk/etc. by implementing the same small interface the app uses: `getCurrentUser()` / `requireUser()` for Server Components and Server Actions.
- Avoid scattering `userId` discovery logic across the codebase—centralize it so the backing implementation can change in one place.

## Routes and Flows (conceptual)

| Flow | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Sign-up** | Validate input → check username/email uniqueness → hash password → insert user → create session → redirect to MCQ list (or home). |
| **Login** | Resolve user by email/username → verify hash → create session → redirect. |
| **Logout** | Clear session cookie; optionally revoke server-side session record if you add a sessions table later. |
| **Protected routes** | MCQ list, create/edit, preview/attempt, and any API that records attempts should **require** an authenticated user. Public marketing pages may stay unauthenticated if desired. |

## Relationship to MCQs and Attempts

- Every **attempt** row references `user_id` (see `MCQ_CRUD.md`).
- Anonymous attempts are **out of scope** for v1; unauthenticated users should be redirected to login (or sign-up) before viewing protected MCQ flows.

## Security Notes (v1)

- Use HTTPS in production (Cloudflare Workers default).
- Rate-limit login and sign-up endpoints (Cloudflare rate limiting or app-level counters) to reduce brute-force risk.
- CSRF: for cookie-based sessions, prefer SameSite cookies and consistent origin checks; if you add cross-site APIs, revisit CSRF tokens.
- Document environment secrets (e.g. session signing key) in `.dev.vars` / Wrangler secrets, never in source control.

## Future Extensions (not required for v1)

- Email verification, password reset, OAuth providers.
- Dedicated `sessions` table for revocation and multi-device management.
- Role-based access (e.g. teacher vs student) on top of the same `users` table.
